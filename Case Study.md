## Evaluation for [Investment-mobile-app](https://dribbble.com/shots/19686568-Investment-mobile-app)
- I really liked the way they have displayed the card like UI on the screen which resembles the feel of Physical card.
- The way they have displayed investment is amazing because it shows a mini graph on the side to a particular investment, as well it allows allows the filtration.
- I love the way they display on the top with quite resnable sized text about the available offers for the investment.
- I really liked the color scheme because the texts are clearly visible it does'nt hide to background color.
- Modern apps uses various navigation ways but bottom navigation is one of the popular one.

- I really liked the way they have displayed the card like UI on the screen which resembles the feel of Physical card.
- I think it is a good way to display transaction below the card, it makes a connection between the selected card and transaction for the same.
- The cool colors used in the app make it feel like many modern apps.
- I did'nt like the way the text which is small just above the big text. According to few guideline the text should always go from big to small as going down.
- Send and receive money screen is kind of neat it clearly displays what the button's, action will be and it also displays list of people so the user can select a person to send money.
- Also there is a selection which allow user to choose the cards.
- I think text with grey color does not stand-up to the color scheme used.

## Plan
- I will also be using ideas of the transaction section and send money UI from [Investment-mobile-app](https://dribbble.com/shots/19686568-Investment-mobile-app), [Banking-App](https://dribbble.com/shots/21113553-Banking-App)
- Will display transaction below the cards as listview which will have the name for the transaction, amount deducted/deposited for the previous **3 or 4** transaction.
- Investment will display the stocks in listview where it will show the name of the stock, amount invested, the change in the market value, and the change in the percent in past 24 hours.
- There will also be a UI layout for displaying the recent people in send money, for convenient selection.
- The first page will ask the user to login.
- The main screen will show the user if they want to add new card.
- The investment screen will ask the user if they want to make new investment or add exsisting investment.
- To summarize, I think the feature such as sending/receiving money, investing money, adding cards, and app suggesting offers to user will make this app successful.
  
  ## Overall Design
    * The app will show the added cards on main screen making it the most eye catching component of the app. Just like the many apps available it makes user feel more comfortable using the app. [Investment-mobile-app](https://dribbble.com/shots/19686568-Investment-mobile-app)
    * Main screen will display the transaction history below the cards. In my perspective it makes sense to display the transaction where the card is, because it creates the connection between card and transaction. [Banking-App](https://dribbble.com/shots/21113553-Banking-App)
    * The app will display send and received money for each month.
    * This app will consist of multiple screens, and different screens will be dedicated to perform various operation.
    * I really like send money section in [Wallet-App-UI](https://dribbble.com/shots/17592495-Wallet-App-UI), because it makes easy for user to select the person or to add new person.
    * User can pay bill by entering the ID number they are paying for.
    * Innvestment screen will have a button which will ask the user to add their existing investment or make a new Stock investment through the app. I really like the way how they display the logo for the stock [Investment-mobile-app](https://dribbble.com/shots/19686568-Investment-mobile-app).

## Target User
The target user for this app could be possibly someone who likes modern apps with design which is colorful and simplistic, and the user having in mind the features such as sending and receiving, and sometimes using other financial features. Teenage user would most frequently use the sending / receiving money, because they may not have any mortgage, they might have a Investment in stocks or TFSA so they might be interacting with that section. There can be user who would just use the app for investments.
