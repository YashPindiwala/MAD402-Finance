* Main screen will display the transaction history below the cards. In my perspective it makes sense to display the transaction where the card is, because it creates the connection between card and transaction. [Banking-App](https://dribbble.com/shots/21113553-Banking-App)
* The app will display send and received money for each month.
* This app will consist of multiple screens, and different screens will be dedicated to perform various operation.
* I really like send money section in [Wallet-App-UI](https://dribbble.com/shots/17592495-Wallet-App-UI), because it makes easy for user to select the person or to add new person.
* User can pay bill by entering the ID number they are paying for.
